<summary><b>AP Calculus AB</b></summary>AP Calculus AB follows the curriculum set forth by the College Board. It is worth the equivalent of one semester of college credit upon successful completion of the AP examination offered in May. Students enrolled in this course are required to take this test. Topics covered include library of functions, limits, the derivative, applications of the derivative, definite and indefinite integrals, applications of integration, etc<a href="https://ca-math.github.io/courses/index-ab.html" target="_blank">.</a><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="w3.toggleShow('#notes-ab'); w3.toggleShow('#placeholder-ab');"></a>

<summary><b>Multivariable Calculus</b></summary>Multivariable Calculus extends differential and integral calculus concepts to functions in two or more variables. The topics include vectors, dot products, cross products, equations of lines and planes, surfaces, vector-valued functions, derivatives and integrals of vector-valued functions, space curves, partial and directional derivatives, extrema, double and triple integrals, etc. The curriculum may include concepts such as vector fields, line integrals, applications from the natural sciences or content from abstract mathematics topics<a href="https://ca-math.github.io/courses/index-mvc.html" target="_blank">.</a><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="w3.toggleShow('#notes-mvc'); w3.toggleShow('#placeholder-mvc');"></a>

<summary><b>AP Computer Science A</b></summary> AP Computer Science A is both a college-prep course for potential computer science majors and a foundation course for students planning to study in other technical fields such as engineering, physics, chemistry, and geology. The course emphasizes methodology, procedural abstraction, and in-depth study of algorithms, data structures, and data abstractions, as well as a detailed examination of a large case study program. Instruction includes preparation for the AP Computer Science A exam. In this course, students apply the programming tools they have learned to real-life examples on their own. Computer science is more than just programming; students who successfully complete the course will have an understanding of Java and the ability to adapt to any new programming language that they are taught in college<a href="https://ca-math.github.io/courses/index-csa.html" target="_blank">.</a><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="w3.toggleShow('#notes-csa'); w3.toggleShow('#placeholder-csa');"></a>

<summary><b>Linear Algebra</b></summary> Linear Algebra is a crossroads where many important areas of mathematics meet, and it is the tool used to analyze the first approximation of complex systems. Students will learn to understand and use the language and theorems in both abstract and applied situations, gain insight into the nature of mathematical inquiry, and learn how to reason carefully and precisely about formally described situations. Topics include vectors and subspaces of the n-dimensional space, linear transformations, and matrices; systems of linear equations; abstract vector spaces and the theory of single linear transformation: change of basis, determinants, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and diagonalization<a href="https://ca-math.github.io/courses/index-la.html" target="_blank">.</a><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="w3.toggleShow('#notes-la'); w3.toggleShow('#placeholder-la');"></a>

<summary><b>attendance</b></summary>
If you must be absent and you know ahead of time, then let me know and I will try to refer you to the topic to be covered that day. You are responsible for obtaining missed notes and other class details from your classmates. Given the pace of the curriculum, I must inform you that one missed class meeting can have a big impact on your progress in this course.

<summary><b>calculators</b></summary>
TI-83/84/89/NSPIRE are recommended graphing calculator models. The in-class demonstrations will focus on the TI-84 features. Be sure to check the calculator policy on the college board website at <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/exam-policies-guidelines/calculator-policies" target="_blank">this link</a>. In addition to the graphing calculator, we will also use a few CAS applications, so be sure to bring your laptop to class daily.
