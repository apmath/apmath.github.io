I am an educator and technology enthusiast from the New England region in the United States. On this site you'll find content and bookmarks related to my past and present teaching experiences, mainly focusing on the advanced placement (AP) calculus curriculum. I've had the privilege of teaching both levels of AP Calculus ever since I started out as an independent school teacher in 2005. My other classroom experiences include: Multivariable Calculus (2010 - present), AP Computer Science A (2009 - present), AP Statistics (2007 - 2009), Linear Algebra (2017 - 2019), and independent studies in computer science and mathematics.
