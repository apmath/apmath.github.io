I am an educator and technology enthusiast from the New England region in the United States. On this site I share content related to my past and present teaching experiences, mainly focusing on the advanced placement (AP) calculus curriculum. Many of the links on the <i> courses</i> page point to the public sections of the college board website you'll also find other bookmarks and resources I've used in my classroom over the years.
